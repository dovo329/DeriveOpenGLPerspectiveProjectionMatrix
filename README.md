# Derive OpenGL Projection Matrix

Math and diagrams showing the derivation of the OpenGL Projection Matrix.

Created by Douglas Carl Voss 2018.

I added detail, more explanation, and clarity to the derivation I originally learned with from Joe Farrell at https://www.codeguru.com/cpp/misc/misc/graphics/article.php/c10123/Deriving-Projection-Matrices.htm

I got my 3d math background from "3D Math Primer For Graphics and Game Development" by Dunn and Parberry, ISBN-13: 978-1568817231, ISBN-10: 1568817231.

I drew the image diagrams in Sketch by Bohemian Coding.
